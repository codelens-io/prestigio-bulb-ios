# Prestigio RGB lightbulb app for iOS

I own an old Presitigio RGB bulb, which cannot be controlled with the iOS app found
in the AppStore, so I sniffed the service, characteristics and GATT command byte arrays
from the Prestigio's old android app (which works fine though) and wrote this little
SwiftUI app according to the found details.
